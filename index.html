				As the title lays out pretty clearly. I have upgraded the projects and userscripts pages to automatically update whenever I upload or create or whatever a new one automatically. I also made it so that should a section ever have too much to fit it no longer scrolls the whole page and only the content. An oversight I didn't realize was there as I didn't properly test it and it only came to my attention now with testing out the upgraded sections for the projects and userscripts pages.
